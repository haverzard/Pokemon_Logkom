Simple pokemon project with GNU PROLOG

## Platform : GNU Prolog (Linux Ubuntu)

## How to use:
- GNU Prolog
Installation: sudo apt install gprolog

## How to play:
Compile main.pl with gplc ('gplc main.pl') on terminal. Then, a binary file, that can be executed, will appear. Before running the binary file, make sure there are SoundTrack folder (and its contents), song.pl file, frame.pl file, and petabaru.txt file on the same folder with the binary file. Start with command './main' on terminal.
